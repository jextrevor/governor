## A highly customizable and complex nonlinear object system, written in Python.

The goals of this project are to:

- Create a framework that can be easily integrated into existing projects
- Be able to easily create modules within the existing parent-child object oriented system
- Allow modules to be dynamically rerouted and allow modules of all types to easily interface with each other
- Help developers create complex programs such as simulations that make use of this modular system.
