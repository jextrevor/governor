# Governor
## A highly customizable and complex nonlinear object system, written in Python.

The goals of this project are to:

- Create a framework that can be easily integrated into existing projects
- Be able to easily create modules within the existing parent-child object oriented system
- Allow modules to be dynamically rerouted and allow modules of all types to easily interface with each other
- Help developers create complex programs such as simulations that make use of this modular system.

To include this package in your project, just drop the folder into your project and import everything:
from governor.runtime import Runtime
from governor.module import Module

You are encouraged to use this in your project any way you want.
